---

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set

## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

## Data Set Summary & Exploration

This project's data is [German Traffic Data Set](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) for creating model.

* The size of training set is 34799.
* The size of test set is 12630.
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is distributed.

## Design and Test a Model Architecture

### Preprocessed the Image Data

#### Grayscale

I converted traning images from RGB to grayscale image for cutting calculate cost and creating model by luminance not colar.

### Nomalization

I normalized traning images for stretching contrast.

### Model Architecture
2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 28x28x6 	|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Max pooling	2x2      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x6 				|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 10x10x16 	|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Max pooling	2x2      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16 				|
| Flatten	    | inputs 400, outputs 120      									|
| Fully connected		| inputs 120, outputs 84        									|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Fully connected		| inputs 120, outputs 84        									|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Fully connected		| inputs 84, outputs 43        									|
| Softmax				|         									|


* Convolution layer's output is calcuated by W -2[H/2] * W -2[H/2]. ([ãƒ»] is round down.) When input data is 32x32 and filter is 5x5, output data is 28x28. 
* RELU means rectified linear. f(u) = max(u, 0)
* Fully connected layer...
* Between Softmax and RELU

### How To Train My Model

| Optimizer         		|     Batch Size	        					| Number of epochs | Learning rate |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| [Adam Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf)       		| 100   							| 60 | 0.0009 |


Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

### Approach

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 0.930
* validation set accuracy of 0.930
* test set accuracy of 0.915

4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

## Test a Model on New Images

### How to Test Model
1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

<img src="./test_images/1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: left;"> <img src="./test_images/2.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"> <img src="./test_images/3.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">  
<img src="./test_images/4.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: left;"> <img src="./test_images/5.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"> <img src="./test_images/6.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

#### Test Discussion
2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

#### Softmax Probabilities
3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ... 

### TODO
* (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)

### Others
* If you use `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` at your local environment, you should do this command after install `jupyter notebook` because default `iopub_data_rate_limit` is too low to create model.

```
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000
```
