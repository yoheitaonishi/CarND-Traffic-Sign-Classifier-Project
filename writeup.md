## Data Set Summary & Exploration

This project's data is [German Traffic Data Set](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) for creating model.

* The size of training set is 34799.
* The size of test set is 12630.
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is distributed.

## Design and Test a Model Architecture

### Preprocessed the Image Data

#### Grayscale

I converted traning images from RGB to grayscale image for cutting calculate cost and creating model by luminance not colar.

### Nomalization

I normalized traning images for stretching contrast.

## Model Architecture

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 28x28x6 	|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Max pooling	2x2      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x6 				|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, same padding, outputs 10x10x16 	|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Max pooling	2x2      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x16 				|
| Flatten	    | inputs 400, outputs 120      									|
| Fully connected		| inputs 120, outputs 84        									|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Fully connected		| inputs 120, outputs 84        									|
| RELU					| for activation |
| Fully connected		| inputs 84, outputs 43        									|
| Softmax				| for classification         									|


* Convolution layer's output is calcuated by W -2[H/2] * W -2[H/2]. ([ãƒ»] is round down.) When input data is 32x32 and filter is 5x5, output data is 28x28. 
* RELU means rectified linear unit. f(u) = max(u, 0)
* Fully connected layer...
* Softmax layer decides output by each inputs not sum of inputs.

## How To Train My Model

| Optimizer         		|     Batch Size	        					| Number of epochs | Learning rate |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| [Adam Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf)       		| 100   							| 60 | 0.0009 |

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 0.930
* validation set accuracy of 0.930
* test set accuracy of 0.915

## Test a Model on New Images

### How to Test Model
1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

<img src="./test_images/1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: left;"> <img src="./test_images/2.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"> <img src="./test_images/3.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">  
<img src="./test_images/4.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: left;"> <img src="./test_images/5.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"> <img src="./test_images/6.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

### Test Discussion

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Yield      		| Yield   									| 
| Stop     			| Keep right 										|
| Slippery road					| Slippery road											|
| Road work	      		| Road work					 				|
| Children crossing			| Children crossing      							|
| No entry			| No entry      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set, the accuracy on the test set is better than one of new traffic signs from website. I think this fact comes from number of images. The accuracy of new traffic signs from website will be better if number of them increases.

### Softmax Probabilities
3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ... 

## TODO
* (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)

## Others
* If you use `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` at your local environment, you should do this command after install `jupyter notebook` because default `iopub_data_rate_limit` is too low to create model.

```
jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000000
```
